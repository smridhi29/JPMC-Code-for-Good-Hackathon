# Future Enhancements
* With more efficient and modern technology, we could modify the project so as to have all webinars and classes on the same portal itself.
* With more time in hand, we can develop this into an app as well for easy routine usage.
* With more expertise in technology, we can integrate a machine learning algorithm which can identify the faces of the mentees under every mentor and mark their attendance accordingly.
